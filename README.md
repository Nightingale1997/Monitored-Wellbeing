## Physical Device
Tested and working on OnePlus 6

The app requires a working camera and flash to run correctly. If testing outside of kuggen, may require GPS spoofing on the device. Open the project in android studio and run. Log in with either e-mail or google account to get to the main part of the application.

## Emulator

Tested on Emulated Nexus 4

Heartrate measuring is difficult on an emulator. It is possible to press the ALT key (On Windows) to move the camera and "trick" the app into measuring the simulated image.

Test on larger devices, the UI does not look right on all screen sizes. Some phones (Especially those with an AMOLED display) do not show gradients correctly in the emulator, the image appears banded or low-res. App otherwise works correctly.
